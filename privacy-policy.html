The following Privacy Policy is a template generated based on common practices and information provided about the "ID Photo Generator" application. It is for informational purposes only and should not be considered legal advice. You MUST consult with a qualified legal professional to ensure your Privacy Policy is complete, accurate, and complies with all applicable laws and regulations (like GDPR, CCPA, etc.) relevant to your users and your application's operations.

        <h1 class="privacy-main-title">Privacy Policy for "ID Photo Generator"</h1>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to "ID Photo Generator" (referred to as "the App", "we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our application. Our core principle is to respect your privacy, and as such, the App is designed to process images locally on your device without uploading your photos to our servers.</p>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Given the nature of the App, the information we "collect" is primarily what you provide and what is processed locally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uploaded Photos:</strong> The App requires you to upload a photo to generate an ID photo. This photo is processed directly within your web browser on your device. We do not upload, store, or transmit your original or processed photos to our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data (Non-Personal):</strong> To improve user experience and app functionality, we may collect anonymous, aggregated data such as browser type, device type, operating system, and usage patterns (e.g., features used, session duration). This data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally. We may use services like Google Analytics for this purpose, which have their own privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Configuration Settings:</strong> Preferences you set within the App, such as background color choice or selected output format, may be stored locally in your browser (e.g., using localStorage) to enhance your experience on subsequent visits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide the Service:</strong> Your uploaded photo is used solely for the purpose of generating an ID photo as per your requested edits (background removal, color change, resizing). This processing occurs entirely on your local device.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the Service:</strong> Anonymized technical data helps us understand how users interact with the App, identify areas for improvement, and optimize performance.</li>
            <li><strong>To Maintain Functionality:</strong> Locally stored settings are used to remember your preferences and provide a consistent user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">Data Handling and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All image processing, including background removal and modifications, is performed directly in your web browser. Your images do not leave your device to be processed by our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>No Server Storage of Images:</strong> We reiterate that we do not store your uploaded or generated photos on our servers at any point. You are responsible for saving the generated ID photo to your own device.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> While we do not transmit your photos, we implement reasonable security measures in our web application to protect against unauthorized access or alteration of the app's code and any non-personal data we might collect. However, no internet-based service can be 100% secure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We may use third-party services for specific functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> As mentioned, we may use services like Google Analytics to gather anonymous usage data. Please refer to Google Analytics' privacy policy for more information on their data practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> If the App includes advertisements (e.g., Google AdSense), these third-party ad networks may use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with ads. This information is used to serve relevant ads. We do not share your uploaded photos with advertisers. Please consult the privacy policies of these ad networks for details on their data collection and use.</li>
            <li><strong>Libraries and CDNs:</strong> The App may use third-party libraries or content delivery networks (CDNs) for fonts, scripts (like Tailwind CSS), or other assets to improve performance and functionality. These services may collect technical data as per their own privacy policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">User Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not store your personal images on our servers, your control primarily relates to the data on your own device and any interactions with third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Control of Photos:</strong> You have full control over the photos on your device. You choose which photo to upload, and you choose whether to save the generated photo.</li>
            <li><strong>Clearing Browser Data:</strong> You can clear your browser's cache and local storage to remove any locally stored preferences or data related to the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Managing Cookies:</strong> You can manage cookies through your browser settings, including those used by third-party services like analytics or advertising.</li>
            <li><strong>Opting-out of Analytics/Advertising:</strong> Where applicable, you may be able to opt-out of tracking by analytics or advertising services through their respective mechanisms (e.g., Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, ad network opt-out pages).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date (if applicable). You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us. (Provide a method of contact, e.g., an email address or a link to a contact form if available. For this example, let's assume a placeholder: <a href="mailto:privacy@example-photostudio.com">privacy@example-photostudio.com</a>).</p>

        <h2 class="privacy-section-title">Key Sections and Considerations (Summary)</h2>
        <p>This section is intended for you, the developer, to ensure these points are robustly and accurately addressed in your final, legally-reviewed policy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uploaded Photos:</strong> Explicitly state that photos are processed locally and NOT stored on your servers. Detail the lifecycle of an uploaded image (loaded into browser memory, processed, user downloads, then it's gone from the app's direct control unless the user re-uploads).</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data (Analytics):</strong> Clearly list what anonymous data is collected (e.g., browser version, OS, feature usage frequency, error occurrences). If using Google Analytics or similar, name them and link to their privacy policies. Explain the purpose (improving the app, fixing bugs).</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> If using ads (e.g., AdSense), explain that ad providers may collect data to personalize ads. Link to the ad provider's privacy policy. Clarify you don't share user photos with ad networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Emphasize local processing as a key security feature for images. For any non-personal data you do handle, describe your security measures.</li>
            <li><strong>Children's Privacy:</strong> State whether the app is intended for children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). If not, state you do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If it is, you'll need to comply with COPPA or similar regulations, which is complex.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Links:</strong> If your app or site links to other third-party sites, state that you are not responsible for their privacy practices and users should review their policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies and Local Storage:</strong> Explain what you use them for (e.g., preferences, session information if applicable, analytics, ads). Provide information on how users can manage them.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Basis for Processing (e.g., for GDPR):</strong> If applicable to your users, you may need to state the legal basis for processing any data (even anonymized data for analytics might be considered if it involves cookies). This is a key area for legal advice.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retention (for non-image data):</strong> Explain how long any non-personal data collected (e.g., analytics logs, locally stored preferences) is kept.</li>
            <li><strong>International Data Transfers:</strong> If any data (even anonymized analytics) is transferred across borders (e.g., if you use servers or third-party services hosted in different countries), this needs to be addressed.</li>
        </ul>
