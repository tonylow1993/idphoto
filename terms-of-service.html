        <h1 class="terms-main-title">Terms of Service (TOS) for "ID Photo"</h1>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the "ID Photo" application (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("TOS") and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions, then you may not access or use the Service.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The Service allows users to upload their photographs and process them to create ID photos. Features include background removal, background color changes, and image resizing. All image processing is performed locally on the user's device. The Service does not store user-uploaded images on its servers.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uploaded Content:</strong> You are solely responsible for the photos you upload and process using the Service. You affirm that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize us to use your photos in the manner contemplated by the Service and these TOS. You agree not to upload any content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> You agree to use the Service in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, laws regarding the creation and use of identification photos.</li>
            <li><strong>Prohibited Uses:</strong> You may not use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to create ID photos for fraudulent purposes. You agree not to misuse the Service, including but not limited to, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our systems or engaging in any activity that disrupts, diminishes the quality of, interferes with the performance of, or impairs the functionality of the Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country to consent to online services) to use the Service. If you are under the required age, you may only use the Service with the consent of your parent or legal guardian.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Our Rights:</strong> The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of "ID Photo" and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the [Your Country/Jurisdiction] and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Rights:</strong> You retain all ownership rights to the photos you upload and process using the Service. We do not claim any ownership rights over your content.</li>
            <li><strong>License to Us (for providing the service):</strong> By uploading content, you grant us a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify (e.g., remove background, resize), and display such content solely for the purpose of operating and providing the Service to you. This license terminates when your content is deleted from your browser or you cease using the Service with that content. Since images are processed locally, this license primarily applies to the temporary handling of data within your browser session.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">5. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>As-Is Service:</strong> The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. We expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</li>
            <li><strong>No Warranty:</strong> We make no warranty that the Service will meet your requirements, or that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, error-free, or that defects will be corrected. We make no warranty regarding the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the Service or that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material obtained by you through the Service will meet your expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall "ID Photo", its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy of Generated Photos:</strong> While the Service aims to help users create ID photos that meet common standards, we do not guarantee that photos generated by the Service will be accepted by any particular institution or authority. It is your responsibility to ensure that the generated photos meet the specific requirements of the entity to which you are submitting them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">6. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the TOS.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All provisions of the TOS which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">7. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These TOS shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/State/Jurisdiction, e.g., "the State of California, United States"], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these TOS will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these TOS is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these TOS will remain in effect. These TOS constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">8. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these TOS at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least [e.g., 30 days'] notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-section-title">9. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us. (Provide a method of contact, e.g., an email address or a link to a contact form if available.
